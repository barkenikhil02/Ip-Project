  <h3>What's this about?</h3>
  <p>
    A quiz can be identified as a form of a game or a mind  sport. Players can be divided into teams or they play individually. They attempt to answer questions correctly and often play against each other to get the highest score and of course to beat each other :) Quizzes are not only used to test general knowledge, like a pub quiz, but also in different companies and in education.
